Project Proposal:
A 1-page PDF of your project proposal is due by Nov 8. We will send you feedback ~1 week later. Please note that your project proposal will factor into your overall project grade, so make sure that it is written well and follows the guidelines below
Include the following information:
Project title
Data set
Project idea. This should be approximately two paragraphs.
Software you will need to write.
Papers to read. Include 1-3 relevant papers. You will probably want to read at least one of them before submitting your proposal
Teammate (if any) and work division. We expect projects done in a
group to be more substantial than projects done individually.
Midterm milestone: What will you complete by Nov 29? Specifically, what baselines will you try on your datasets and what kind of results
do you expect to report?
