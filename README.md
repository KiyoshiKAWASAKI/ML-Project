# ML-Project
Machine Learning Project for 2016 fall

Milestones:
1. Project proposal – Due Date: Nov 8 (10%)
2. Midway Report - Due Date Nov 29 ( 25%)
3. Final Presentation – Dec 12th and Dec 13th. (20%)
4. Final Report – Dec 12th. (45%)

Project Proposal:
A 1-page PDF of your project proposal is due by Nov 8. We will send you feedback ~1 week later. Please note that your project proposal will factor into your overall project grade, so make sure that it is written well and follows the guidelines below
Include the following information:
Project title
Data set
Project idea. This should be approximately two paragraphs.
Software you will need to write.
Papers to read. Include 1-3 relevant papers. You will probably want to read at least one of them before submitting your proposal
Teammate (if any) and work division. We expect projects done in a
group to be more substantial than projects done individually.
Midterm milestone: What will you complete by Nov 29? Specifically, what baselines will you try on your datasets and what kind of results
do you expect to report?

Midway Report:
This should be a 5-8 pages report and it serves as a check-point. By this date you should have applied one or more commonly used learning methods on a specific problem. The report should include:
- Background section which describes the problem you are tackling, - Related work section,
- Description of the method(s) you tried,
- Experiments section with detailed description of the dataset you
experimented with and the results you obtained.

Final Report:
The structure of the final report is similar to that of the midterm report. By that time you should extend the baseline(s) you tried in an interesting and creative way. That can include feature engineering, optimizing the training algorithm, modifications to the model ... etc.
For your final report you need to include a code section. Either a link to a github repo or a zip archive. Here are some examples of how to write up your project

Final Presentation:
Your final presentation will be in class to your classmates, TAs, Professor and potentially other faculty members and guests. You may do a video for the presentation if you like for some extra credit. You can find some video presentations of students' final projects.
The final presentation will take place on the last day of class before finals Dec 12th. Aim for a 5-7 minute talk that summarizes the results in an engaging way. The presentations should target a technical but not a Machine Learning class audience and serve the purpose of having students practice the highly sought after communication skills that data scientists need. You should think you are presenting to other CS students as your audience. Focus on creating an engaging, clear, and informative presentation that tells the story of your project.
Presentation contents:
 Overview of problem and hypothesis
 Overview of your data
 Modeling techniques used and why (save the details for your paper)
 Conclusions
 Further research and/or business opportunities
